 * Sample class CucumberIntegrationTest serves as the entry point to test Customer related functionalities.
 * You can name this class however you want, but be sure to append “Test” keyword in the class name, otherwise, maven won’t find the Cucumber tests.
 *
 * @Cucumber is to instruct JUnit 5 to use this runner so we have all the Cucumber functionality.
 * It’s equivalent to JUnit 4’s @RunWith(Cucumber.class).
